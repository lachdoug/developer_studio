I do not support the construction of playing fields, for football and such, on the land.

My family and I are involved in the Hurlstone Park Wanderers Football Club. We play at Beaman and Ewan Parks. The fields are busy and heavily used. I can appreciate why many in the club want to see more playing space in the area.

My impression is that in our community golf is less popular than football. This means that when used as golf course, the land will have fewer people using it than if it is used for other sports. This is a major advantage of using it as a golf course: as a gold course the area can remain as a quiet area for the community.
